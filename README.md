# NetApp-FabricPool-Best-Practices
Based on the NetApp FabricPool Best Practices document, this is a collaborative documentation project that restructured the [NetApp FabricPool Best Practices](https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/17239-tr-4598.pdf) technical report into a cohesive, user-oriented guide. In this project, our technical writing team focused on transforming this document into a user guide that could be featured in the NetApp docs wiki by focusing on the rhetorical aspects of user documentation. 

Special thanks to Grant Glass and Dr. Jordynn Jack for facilitating this project.
